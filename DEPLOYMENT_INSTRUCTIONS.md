# Manual Deployment Instructions

## Current Status
- ✅ **API Key is Valid** (as shown in your Publish tab)
- ✅ **Code is ready for deployment** (all search fixes committed)
- ✅ **37 real workers imported locally** (working search functionality)
- ⚠️ **Need to deploy to production** to fix "No Results" issue

## Option 1: Deploy Using Cloudflare Dashboard

### Step 1: Access Cloudflare Pages Dashboard
1. Go to https://dash.cloudflare.com/
2. Navigate to **Pages** in the left sidebar
3. Find your **kwikr-platform** project

### Step 2: Connect to GitHub (if not already connected)
1. Click on your **kwikr-platform** project
2. Go to **Settings** → **Builds & deployments**
3. Connect to your GitHub repository: `getkwikr25/kwikr-platform`
4. Set build command: `npm run build`
5. Set build output directory: `dist`

### Step 3: Trigger Deployment
1. In your **kwikr-platform** project dashboard
2. Click **Create deployment**
3. Select the latest commit (contains all search fixes)
4. Click **Save and Deploy**

## Option 2: Deploy Using wrangler CLI Locally

If you have wrangler installed locally with proper API permissions:

```bash
# Build the project
npm run build

# Deploy to Cloudflare Pages
npx wrangler pages deploy dist --project-name kwikr-platform
```

## Expected Result After Deployment

Once deployed, visit your production URL and search for "Plumbing":
- **Before**: "0 providers found"
- **After**: Should show real plumbers like "Plumbing Ambulance Inc (Mississauga, ON)"

## If Still Getting "No Results"

The production database may be empty. In that case, we need to import the worker data to production. I can provide the import scripts to run once deployment is complete.

## Need Help?

Let me know:
1. **Can you access Cloudflare Pages dashboard?**
2. **Do you see the kwikr-platform project there?**
3. **What happens when you try to deploy?**

The search functionality is working perfectly - we just need to get it live!
