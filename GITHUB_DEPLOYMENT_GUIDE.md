# GitHub Auto-Deployment Setup

## 🚀 **Easiest Solution: GitHub Integration**

Since the sandbox API token is having caching issues, let's use Cloudflare's GitHub integration for automatic deployment:

### **Step 1: Connect GitHub to Cloudflare Pages**
1. Go to: https://dash.cloudflare.com/
2. Navigate to **Pages**
3. Find your **kwikr-platform** project
4. Click **Settings** → **Builds & deployments**
5. Connect to GitHub repository: `getkwikr25/kwikr-platform`

### **Step 2: Configure Build Settings**
Set these build configuration:
- **Build command**: `npm run build`
- **Build output directory**: `dist`
- **Root directory**: `/` (leave empty or root)
- **Node.js version**: `18` or `20`

### **Step 3: Trigger Deployment**
Once connected, any push to the `main` branch will auto-deploy!

Since we just pushed all the search fixes, it should deploy the latest code automatically.

## 📋 **Current Code Status**
✅ **All search fixes committed** (latest commit: "Import real worker data from Excel file")  
✅ **37 real workers ready** (working locally)  
✅ **Database queries fixed** (no more subscription errors)  
✅ **Frontend API routes fixed** (proper paths)

## 🎯 **Expected Results After Deployment**
- **Search functionality working** (no more crashes)
- **Better error handling** (graceful when no data)
- **Ready for worker data import** (once deployment complete)

## 🔍 **After Deployment Test**
Visit your production URL and search for "Plumbing":
- **If results show**: Great! Worker data exists in production
- **If "0 results"**: Production database is empty (we'll import data)

## ⚡ **Alternative: Manual Upload**
If GitHub integration doesn't work:
1. Download the `dist` folder from this project
2. In Cloudflare Pages, use **"Upload assets"** 
3. Upload the entire `dist` folder contents

**Try the GitHub integration first - it's the most reliable method!**
